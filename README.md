# The-Crimson-Plateau
Early development neo-western crime game. The game will be a high-risk, high-reward crime simulation in a punishing environment. Cops will be trying to bust you or shake you down. Rival gangs will try to muscle in on your turf and sabotage your operations. To combat them, you need to keep making money, upgrade your operations, and hire experienced henchmen. Your enemies will be trying to do the same, so you'll need to stay one step ahead.

Currently designing, building, and testing code to emulate a bootlegging system similar to Scarface: The World is Yours.

Many planned mechanics are inspired by Scarface: The World is Yours, including Scarface's distribution system, heat system, and aspects of the empire system. Other inspirations for planned game mechanics are the Grand Theft Auto series and the Godfather video game series.
